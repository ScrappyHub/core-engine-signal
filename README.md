# CORE ENGINE — SIGNAL (Sensor Fusion & Inference)

SIGNAL converts multi-engine outputs into provable metrics:
- FFT + spectral features
- cross-correlation + phase locking
- coherence + coupling strength
- statistical confidence + anomaly detection

Deterministic processing engine. No identity. CORE-governed.
