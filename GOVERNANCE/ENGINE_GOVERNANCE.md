# ENGINE GOVERNANCE — SIGNAL (TRUTH-ADJACENT COMPUTE)

Authority Level: Engine Governance (Binding)  
Engine Role: TRUTH_ADJACENT_COMPUTE  
Status: ✅ BINDING | ✅ NON-OPTIONAL  

---

## 1. GOVERNANCE INHERITANCE

SIGNAL is permanently bound by CORE governance:

- CORE_CONSTITUTIONAL_STOP_LAYER.md  
- CORE_PLATFORM_CONSTITUTION.md  
- CORE_ENGINE_REGISTRY_AND_VERTICAL_INHERITANCE_LAW.md  
- CORE_ENGINE_REGISTRY_CONTRACT.md  
- CORE_GOVERNANCE_INDEX_CHAIN_OF_AUTHORITY.md  

CORE governance supersedes all repository content.

---

## 2. ENGINE ROLE (SPECIAL)

SIGNAL performs **deterministic mathematical transforms** only.

SIGNAL:
- does not generate physical truth
- does not invent data
- does not reinterpret physics
- does not assign meaning

SIGNAL computes transforms such as:
- FFT
- correlation
- coherence
- statistical descriptors

---

## 3. PROHIBITIONS (STRICT)

SIGNAL MUST NOT:
- fabricate inputs
- infer identity or governance state
- infer intent or causality
- generate classifications or conclusions
- access network resources
- publish independently
- call other engines directly

---

## 4. DETERMINISM

All SIGNAL outputs MUST be:
- deterministic
- reproducible
- parameter-bound
- schema-validated

Stochastic methods are prohibited unless explicitly enabled by CORE lane policy.

---

## 5. OUTPUT RULES

SIGNAL outputs:
- transformed representations only
- confidence and statistical descriptors
- no semantic interpretation

Outputs MUST exclude:
- identity
- billing
- governance metadata

---

## 6. CHANGE CONTROL

Any change to transforms, metrics, or outputs requires:
- manifest update
- registry review
- Git audit trail

---

## 7. FINAL DECLARATION

SIGNAL computes **math**, not meaning.

All interpretation is performed by CORE.
